## Deque - DELETION

### AIM  
To write a Python program to delete elements at FRONT END of deque using a collection built-in function.

### ALGORITHM  

1. Import the `deque` class from the `collections` module.  
2. Create an empty deque.  
3. Define how many elements to input (e.g., 3 inputs as in the example).  
4. Loop through the range of input size:  
   - Read an integer from the user.  
   - Append the integer to the deque.  
5. Remove the front element of the deque using `popleft()`.  
6. Print the final deque after deletion.  

### PROGRAM

import collections
n1=input()
n2=input()
n3=input()

col=collections.deque([n1,n2,n3])

col.popleft()

print("The deque after deletion is :")
print(col)
```
